        "- If a scene has a duration <= 8 seconds, it can be mapped to a single shot of the same duration.\n"
        "- If any scene has a duration > 8 seconds, you MUST split it into multiple sequential shots so that each shot's duration is in the range of 4 to 8 seconds (inclusive). For example, a 12-second scene should be split into two 6-second shots; a 10-second scene should be split into two 5-second shots. The sum of the durations of the split shots must exactly equal the total duration of the original scene.\n"
        "- When splitting a scene into multiple shots, you must also distribute the scene's dialogue, actions, and timeline sequentially and logically across the split shots. Ensure that no dialogue or action overlaps or is repeated. If a shot contains a character's dialogue, only include that specific character's speech in that shot's dialogue list.\n"
        "  * Concrete Splitting Example: If a scene is 10s long (Bối cảnh: Cafeteria) and has Description: 'Lisa returns to the table. Emma smiles.' and Dialogue: [Emma: 'Great job!', Lisa: 'Now my hands are clean.']. You should split it into 2 shots:\n"
        "    - Shot A (5s): Focuses on Emma speaking 'Great job!' (e.g. camera framing focusing on Emma, Dialogue list only contains Emma: 'Great job!').\n"

        "1. Camera and framing parameters. You must apply these strict Camera Rule mappings to determine camera_movement and shot_type:\n"

Do NOT use terms like 'boy', 'girl', 'child', or 'kids').\n\n"

Speaking segments must NEVER be shorter than 3 seconds (e.g. do NOT use 2s or 1s intervals for dialogues) to prevent characters from being cut off mid-speech.\n\n"
